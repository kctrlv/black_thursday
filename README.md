## Black Thursday

Black Thursday is a system able to load, parse, search, and execute business intelligence queries against the data from a typical e-commerece business.

Find the [project spec here](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/black_thursday.markdown).

Black Thursday runs in the terminal, and does not have a user interface.

It loads in CSV data in the ./lib/sales_engine.rb file and has many methods to parse the data to gather different business insights about it.
